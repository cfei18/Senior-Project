## THE KINDLE REMOTE: HACKING AN EBOOK READER TO DO MORE THAN READ BOOKS

### Abstract
Have you ever wished you could remote control your computer? With portable computers getting smaller and more powerful, the role of the desktop is shifting towards a media center. Many smartphones come with tools to control your media library, but not everyone uses one. My goal was to design a piece of software that would allow me to control my desktop from a device that I do use -- Amazon's Kindleâ„¢ ebook reader. Many things had to be considered, including feature set, security implications, and application design, in addition to many Kindle-specific problems, such as working around limitations on the display, processor, and most importantly the ability to run third party applications (for which the Kindle does NOT have support). The result was a series of clever design choices that led to the Kindle remote, a personalized remote control for the desktop.
